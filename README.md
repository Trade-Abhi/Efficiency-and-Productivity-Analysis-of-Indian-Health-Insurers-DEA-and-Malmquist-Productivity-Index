Abstractâ€” The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy, including the health insurance industry in India. In this project, we analyze the efficiency and productivity of Indian health insurers in the period of 2019-2022 using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Malmquist DEA. We find that the average efficiency and productivity of the health insurance firms declines during the three years and different firms experience diverging trends.
